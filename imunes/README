************************************************************************
IMUNES - an Integrated Multiprotocol Network Emulator / Simulator
************************************************************************

Overview
========

IMUNES GUI is a simple Tcl/Tk based management console, allowing for
specification and management of virtual network topologies. The emulation
execution engine itself operates within the operating system kernel.


System requirements
===================

    1) Operating system

    IMUNES works on top of the FreeBSD 8 (or higher) kernel that is
    compiled with the VIMAGE option included. A sample kernel kernel
    config file is as follows:
	include GENERIC
	options VIMAGE
	options MROUTING

    To compile the VIMAGE enabled kernel you must have a copy of the
    FreeBSD kernel and create the config file with the above mentioned
    lines.
	$ vi sys/amd64/conf/VIMAGE #for 64bit machines
	$ vi sys/i386/conf/VIMAGE #for 32bit machines

    Then you need to compile and install the kernel and reboot.
	$ config VIMAGE
	$ cd ../compile/VIMAGE
	$ make depend; make
	$ make install
	$ reboot

    2) FreeBSD packages

    The following packages have to be installed for IMUNES to work:
        tcl86.tbz
        tk86.tbz
        tcllib.tbz
        wireshark.tbz
        ImageMagick.tbz

    3) Filesystem for virtual nodes

    For the topologies to work a template filesystem must be created.
    This is done by issuing the make vroot command:
	$ make vroot

    The filesystem is by default created in /var/imunes/vroot.

Installation
============

To install the IMUNES GUI just run make install script.
	$ make install
