GUI:
- fix interface names and address placement
- integrate ipsec GUI implementation.
- add GIF interface to the logical interface menu
- add services to imunes (like ssh and inetd)

annotations:
- select annotation while and after resizing
- layering of annotations - not trivial, because redrawAll clears all annotations and redraws them in the same order they were created.
- sometimes a rectangle can't be created.
- keyboard movement of annotations
- improve color management
- remove empty text annotations
